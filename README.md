# Docker Rancher Utils

A lightweight image containing rancher cli and scripts to ease rancher management.

## Deploy Script

The deploy script deploys a new container to Rancher. It also deploys a sumologic container.

For an example how to use it, see the Makefile target `deploy` (along with `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml`).
